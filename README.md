1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  Artemis Financial is a company in the financial industry aiming to develop a range of financial services for their customers. These services will be designed to cater to the specific needs of each individual consumer,
  allowing them to select the most suitable plan. Additionally, Artemis Financial is committed to implementing strong security measures to safeguard the transfer of information, ensuring that unauthorized access is prevented and the data remains secure.

2. What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
   I found it exciting to perform dependency testing in order to identify vulnerabilities. It is crucial to prioritize secure coding practices to minimize the presence of weak spots that could potentially be exploited by hackers.
   By focusing on software security, a company enhances its overall reputation and credibility. When customers have trust in a company's commitment to security, it becomes more appealing and attracts a larger client base.

3. What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
   The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment for me was identifying them and then working on improving the code.

4. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
   To enhance the level of security, I implemented a multi-step approach. Firstly, I conducted dependency checks to identify existing vulnerabilities and then proceeded to refactor the code accordingly.

5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
   While coding in the integrated development environment (IDE), the initial step involves verifying that there are no syntax errors. It is essential to thoroughly test and run the code to ensure its functionality and minimize any potential issues in the final product.
   Employing the Maven test facilitated error-free code and aided in identifying any vulnerabilities present. Performing the Maven test at various stages of the development process assists in conducting dependency checks and preventing the introduction of new vulnerabilities.

6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
   I primarily relied on the class resource page to access relevant materials for my work. Among the resources, I found the OWASP Dependency-Check-Maven website particularly valuable.

7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
   In this specific task, my goal is to demonstrate the successful implementation of enhanced security protocols. I dedicated considerable effort to researching and conducting thorough testing to identify and mitigate any potential vulnerabilities in the software.
   Emphasizing the importance of security, this assignment showcases my commitment to meeting stringent security requirements and staying up-to-date with the latest security measures.
